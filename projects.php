       <p>
         Worked closely with the founder designing a minimum viable product based on their initial
         ideas and specifications.  The application is designed to help Court Reporters manage their 
         transcripts, set deadlines, budget their time and workload.  I was the lead designer on the 
         product and took the design from the initial stages all the way to the handoff with the developer.
         Throughout development I continnued to consult on design issues.  
         </p>
        <p>
        After the initial launch I was asked to return to add aditional features informed by user feedback.
        This gave me a unique oppertunity to reaccess my original designs and make changes almost a year later.
